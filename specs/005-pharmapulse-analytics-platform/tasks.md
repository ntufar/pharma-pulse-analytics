# Tasks: PharmaPulse Analytics Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-pharmapulse-analytics-platform/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Dependencies

- T020-T023 (Models) block T024-T027 (Services) and T040-T043 (Model Unit Tests).
- T024-T027 (Services) block T028-T031 (API Endpoints) and T044-T047 (Service Unit Tests).
- T028-T031 (API Endpoints) block T036-T039 (Frontend Integration).
- T032 (DB Connection) blocks T024-T027 (Services).

- T034 (Logging) and T035 (CORS/Security) can run in parallel with other implementation tasks but should ideally be in place before extensive testing.
- T036-T039 (Frontend Integration) block T051 (Quickstart Scenarios).
- T040-T047 (Unit Tests) can run in parallel with each other once their respective models/services are implemented.

- T051 (Quickstart Scenarios) is the final validation step.

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [X] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [X] All entities have model tasks
- [X] All tests come before implementation
- [X] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [X] Each task specifies exact file path
- [X] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
