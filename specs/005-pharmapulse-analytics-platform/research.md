# Research for PharmaPulse Analytics Platform

## Phase 0: Outline & Research Findings

### Research Task: Testing Frameworks

**Decision**: To be determined after research.

**Rationale**: The `Technical Context` identified that specific testing frameworks for Python (data stack) and JavaScript/TypeScript (React frontend) for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests need to be determined.

**Alternatives considered**: None yet. This research will identify alternatives.

**Research Question**: What are the suitable testing frameworks for Python (data stack) and JavaScript/TypeScript (React frontend) for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in the context of a CDP platform, considering the specified performance, security, and scalability requirements?
