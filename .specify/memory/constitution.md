# Pharma Pulse Analytics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must adhere to established coding standards, style guides, and best practices. Code reviews are mandatory to ensure readability, maintainability, and robustness. Automated linting and static analysis tools will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is mandatory for all features and bug fixes. This includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Tests must be automated, maintainable, and provide sufficient code coverage. Test failures must block deployments.

### III. User Experience Consistency
All user-facing components must provide a consistent and intuitive user experience. Design systems and UI/UX guidelines must be followed rigorously. User feedback will be actively sought and incorporated into design iterations.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Applications and services must meet defined performance benchmarks, including response times, resource utilization, and scalability. Performance testing will be conducted regularly, and optimizations will be prioritized to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Additional Constraints

All development must align with industry regulations for pharmaceutical data handling and privacy (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR). Security best practices must be integrated throughout the development lifecycle.

## Development Workflow

Development follows an agile methodology with regular sprints, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. All changes must go through a pull request process with at least one approved review before merging to the main branch.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require a formal proposal, team review, and approval by project leads. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
